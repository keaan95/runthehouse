<a href=/tags/medicine>Medicine</a>, <a href=/tags/reflection>Reflection</a></p><span itemprop=articleBody><p><strong>Friday 28th February</strong></p><p>Back in Lanchester Road Hospital Education Centre. It is time for a day of teaching on Bipolar, Personality Disorders and Eating Disorders. Snacks and coffees are plentiful. Mental Health rotation has been very welcoming so far.</p><p>As has been the case so far, we&rsquo;ve been taught some human psychology and sociology. Depression as a battle between stressors and resilience. Bipolar with percentage swings between high and low mood. Personality disorder, a consequence from defence mechanisms that protect you from your inner self. Been very insightful.</p><p>Evening comes so I dart for a train back home. En route, I map out the 10 Year Plan - a presentation for myself, first, and parents, second, on what I expect to do over the next 10 years. More on this on Sunday!</p><p>On a side-note, Coronavirus is spreading! Very difficult times for healthcare. But for the student drowning in student loans, its an interesting time to consider investments. Stocks have crashed today by 2-3% - an ideal time to invest in mutual fund trackers.</p><p><strong>Saturday 29th February</strong></p><p>Got to love waking up at home. Clean bed. A true 8 hours sleep. Today braces come off! Expecting a tension headache but only felt a slightly mild one later that afternoon. Brushing my teeth has never felt better! Gotta take care of them now.</p><p><strong>Sunday 1st March</strong></p><p>Another relaxing day at home followed by a greasy burger and milkshake at GBK with the parents. Just a real staple of a home trip is a burger with the parents. Afterwards, I raise the attention of my parents to the 10 Year Plan presentation. Parents happy with this forethought. Thinking of career pathways - could it be Adult Oncology, could it be Paediatric Oncology? Paediatric Oncology? Certainly have lots of inspirational people to look up to. But my focus right now is just being a good clinical year medical student.</p><p>Just before midnight, launch my first £500 into my mutual investment fund!</p><p><strong>Monday 2nd March</strong></p><p>Arrive at King&rsquo;s Cross at 8.30am. Train breaks down. Board next train at 9am. Delayed at a stop for 3h. Arrive at 3pm. 6.30h train? Feels more similar to a Plymouth to London journey. Rail expenses have been claimed for. But the damage is done. I&rsquo;ve missed an afternoon of patient simulations.</p><p>Whilst I&rsquo;m at home for the afternoon, I complete my budget spreadsheet. Its emailed off to head office - the father for review.</p><p><strong>Tuesday 3rd March</strong></p><p>News in back from Head Office. They approve of the budget. They have one recommendation - do not get too granular. Essentially the safeguards are good. Just don&rsquo;t worry about it.</p><p><strong>Wednesday 3rd March</strong></p><p>Day off from Uni. Always loved - especially with examinations just over two months away. Managed to continue some Flashcard graft. My Flashcard plan should be completed by end of March. Providing April as ample time for consolidation drawing + past exam questions. That is the plan!</p><p><strong>Thursday 4th March</strong></p><p>Mental health continues on. Today is a CDF - simply a formative asssessment of your history + examination skills. Feel comfortable with my plan. After 30-35 minutes of chat, it is concluded. Felt I covered major bases that the patient and I felt comfortable with the plan. Feedback praised the communication skills and open questions. However, execution of the agenda was poor. What was the main diagnosis? Low mood? Sure could be it. But what subtleties did he have in expression and what exactly was he saying. Listening out for verbal cues is critical. Can&rsquo;t get by through simply hoping for keywords.</p><p>So a terrific lesson, take your cues and build a conversation through them. Over time, try and develop a stem of questioning followed by a systematic list of screening questions. Move between lists through having a filtered list of differentials. This will come with time.</p><p>This CDF felt different to the ones before. Sure, I did not get the diagnosis but I felt that this was all within my realms of development. I felt I could dramatically improve this. I felt more assured of myself before and during the consultation. I had a plan that was too rigid and firm. Was not quite flexible and tailored to the patient. This showed but this showed me a good plan to improve. Being Mr Nice may get you a good friendship but you have to take more advantage of the limited time you have to get more out of it.</p><p>After a challenging afternoon, it really was time for a haircut!</p><p><strong>Friday 5th March</strong></p><p>Stocks were falling once more. Another time to invest. This time a heftier amount has been placed. More will need to be put in to get more out of it. It fits my budget so I pull the trigger.</p><p>The financial plan has moved to one of &lsquo;set and forget.&rsquo; This is one for the long-run not monitoring day to day volatile gains. Because at the moment, we&rsquo;re managing losses! Stick with the plan and it will all work itself out.</p></span><div id=disqus_thread></div><script>window.addEventListener('message',receiveMessage,false);function receiveMessage(event){if(event.data){var msg;try{msg=JSON.parse(event.data);}catch(err){}
