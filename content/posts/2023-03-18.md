## the right to looose control
a longer than expected run around today. wanted 12 - found 12+3.

despite legs feeling beat up after. i feel like there'll be enough in them for tomorrow's long run.

strides a slight struggle up the hill. otherwise feeling happy and ready for a breakfast + top-up carbs ahead of tomorrow's long run.
