## mega plod
Been at least two weeks since a relatively easy morning run. This was needed to kick off a productive day.

Strides are a great loosener - gotta incorporate more of these on slow days. So long as I can keep 'em slow.

Strides with the ultraboost felt fantastic. Invincibles are just bulky boys.
