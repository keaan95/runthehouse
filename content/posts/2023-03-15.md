  Time | 4:49 / km + ? + 5.03 / km

* **WARM-UP**: resistance bands on ankle flexion and extension
* **PRE-RUN**: light jog and legs felt heavy - decided to gymn it today instead of threshold 16K
* **Q1**: pre-gym legs feeling dull. stuck in mud.
* **Q2**: in the gym - felt loose and glad i got at least one stride pre work-out
* **Q3**: in the gym - squats (50kg - 5x10,2x15) and split squats (6kg - 2x10,1x12,1x15) - focused on form and keeping legs loose
* **Q4**: post-gym lovely glide up the hill - typical post-gymn legs feeling
* **Happiness**: 6/10
* **Shoe**: Vaporfly Gyakusou (why not) 3/3
* **Stride**: Smooth and feather-like at the beginning - the stamping returned when fatiguing. Hill climb form (as in accelerating on the initial inclimb is non-existent - but will get there)
* **Pain**: Y
* **Where?**: Thighs. Left ankle complete loose now.

## ERW + gym + CD
not a bright idea to smash in 4 freddos and a milk drink and expect a hard workout.

legs were just dead and decided to switch my rest-day from tomorrow to today and schedule threshold tomorrow morning.

taking the vaporflies for added fun really.

felt a lot better post-run. breathing is improving. can't feel any chest pain or feeling of excess phlegm.

## what's ERW?
eat right and warm-up.
