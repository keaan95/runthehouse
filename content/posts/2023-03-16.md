* **WARM-UP**: minimal
* **PRE-RUN**: light jog - tight for time today
* **Q1**: initially wanted to progressively build to marathon speed
* **Q2**: felt like turns are turning over - lets hold it at this
* **Q3**: felt a little sluggish and ragged on the hills but form was so so improved - i remembered to hit the hill with acceleration
* **Q4**: mentally knowing you were almost home really settled my breathing. still feels harder than maybe what i could be - but happy nonetheless.
* **Happiness**: 7/10
* **Shoe**: Fuelcell TC 3/3
* **Stride**: A little bit ploddy but initially felt smooth and legs turning over beautifully. Reminding myself of my form like the old days and need the hold it was keyy
* **Pain**: Y
* **Where?**: very mild abdo cramps from a crappo meal but pleasing to know i can run through this

## lasagna with the boys
mushroom risotto, pork and crisps in the belly. not the best fuel. lasagna with the boys after. class fuel.

a confidence building room. haven't felt this loose since middlesboro albert park.

i'd love to hold this pace for like 30km in my training - i really think i could go for at least 25km = but good to log this session.
