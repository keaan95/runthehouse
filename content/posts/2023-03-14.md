   Day | Stats
--------|------
  Distance   | 18K
  Time | 4:27 / km

* **WARM-UP**: resistance bands on ankle flexion and extension
* **PRE-RUN**: nil lol
* **Q1**: laces untied after 1km but breathing settled. bouncing around - form flying.
* **Q2**: legs beginning to get heavy after hillclimb #3. really dreading it.
* **Q3**: legs clearing up - the magic 10.5K and feeling motivated
* **Q4**: couldn't quite kick to top speed to finish - but legs are back
* **Happiness**: 8/10
* **Shoe**: Terrex Ultra (W) 3/3
* **Stride**: Smooth and feather-like at the beginning - the stamping returned when fatiguing. Hill climb form (as in accelerating on the initial inclimb is non-existent - but will get there)
* **Pain**: Y
* **Where?**: Thighs. Left ankle complete loose now.

legs getting stronger by the day. a beautiful run with the sunset. shame about the laces untieing 3x. hands were so cold - i couldn't fasten them.

The final kick will get back to top speed. Lungs feel clear again - not felt this good in 2 weeks. No chest pain at all.

Although no track tuesday, this was a lovely (and well-needed) substitute.
