## takeaways
A bit of belief you can run through heavy legs. Even if the field blazes past you - you'll catch them up. okay some of them.

Breathing was settled despite heavy legs.

Mentally I was dreading those hills and they weren't even hills.

More hill work and leg strength. A proper warm-up next time.
