## chocolate sponge on wheels
belly once more not ideal. choco sponge, lasagna and cod. but no real cramps. just slightly unsettled.

pleasingly could deal with the tightness and breathing was really settled. felt fluid going up hills.

a lovely cruising type run to keep legs turning over. if legs feel good tomorrow - might friday sunset runs a regular.
